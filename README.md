# City Map and Path Finder

Finds the optimal path between two nodes on a given graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm, the graph is represented as a map with cities and roads. 

## Overview

This project is designed as part of the CMPE160 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming course at Bogazici University. It is a Java application that reads city coordinates and connections from files, draws a map of the cities and roads, and finds the optimal path between two cities using Dijkstra's Algorithm. One file is named `IbrahimBerkayCeylan` because of assignment submission rules.

## Features

- **City Representation**: Each city has a name, coordinates, and connections to other cities.
- **Map Drawing**: Draws a map with cities and roads using StdDraw.
- **Optimal Path Finding**: Uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find and display the shortest path between two cities.
